# Protein Translation Can Fluidize Bacterial Cytoplasm

Welcome to the repository for the research project titled **"Protein Translation Can Fluidize Bacterial Cytoplasm."** This collection of scripts and input files explores various aspects of cytoplasm dynamics during protein translation. The simulations were conducted using the open-source software [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org/) (Abraham et al., SoftwareX, 2015). We have modified the source code to introduce the spherocylindrical confinement. One can download the modified version of Gromacs at the following link: https://github.com/JMLab-tifrh/gromacs_spherocylinder

## Contents

### 1. segregation
This folder contains the scripts and input files for DNA ribosome segregation.

### 2. Crowding
In the **"crowding"** folder, you will find scripts and input files focused on studying the glassy dynamics of different particles in the presence of crowders. Gain insights into how crowding influences the behavior of various molecular components.

### 3. Switch
This folder contains the scripts and input files to study the effect of polysome ribosome conversion on glassy dynamics of bacterial cytoplasm.
